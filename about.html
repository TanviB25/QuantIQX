    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Quision is an independent, educational project designed to make quantitative finance, 
        macro-financial analysis, and statistical methods accessible to students, analysts, 
        and early-career professionals. The focus is on clear explanations, data-driven 
        examples, and interactive tools that help users understand complex concepts 
        intuitively.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive Mini Projects</strong> – Hands-on dashboards and models covering macro indicators, time-series forecasting, and portfolio optimization.</li>
        <li><strong>Short, Structured Lessons</strong> – Blog posts that explain statistical and financial concepts with real-world examples.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Code</strong> – Python, JavaScript, and SQL snippets that demonstrate modern quantitative techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Research-Inspired Visualizations</strong> – BIS-style charts, stress-testing visuals, and economic data dashboards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Quision?</h2>
    <p>
        Quantitative finance education is often fragmented or overly technical. 
        Quision takes a practical approach by combining:<br>
        • real economic datasets,<br>
        • clear statistical methods,<br>
        • interactive, browser-based analytics,<br>
        • and concise, explanation-focused writing.<br><br>
        The result is a learning experience that bridges the gap between academic theory 
        and applied financial analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Project Was Built</h2>
    <p>
        The platform uses lightweight web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) along with 
        Python-generated visualizations (Plotly, pandas, statsmodels). 
        Each mini project is designed to run fully in the browser or as exportable HTML files, 
        making the site easily hostable on GitHub Pages.
